# Encryption

Current encryption method is a custom extension we developed when end-to-end
specificiations were a bit sparse and experimental.

We will soon switch to the new [XEP-0374](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0374.html)
being evaluated these days by the XSF. If you'd like to help the switch, please
refer to issue [#633](/kontalk/androidclient/issues/633).
